/* Supplementary program for Chapter Z */

/* seccomp_multiarch.c

   This program demonstrates one of the reasons that a seccomp filter must
   verify the architecture on *each* system call. The point is that some
   hardware platforms support multiple architectures. For example, modern
   x86 hardware supports x86-64, i386, and x32 architectures. The
   architecture is determined by the binary that is executed, and since a
   process may execute multiple binaries over its lifetime (via successive
   calls to execve()), this means that the architecture may change during
   the life of the process. However, once installed, seccomp filters
   persist for the lifetime of the process; in particular, filters persist
   across calls to execve() (if the filters permit calls to execve()), and
   thus across architecture changes.  Thus, a seccomp filter needs to check
   its architecture assumption each time the filter is invoked.

   The idea behind this program is to build binaries for different
   architectures from this source file. A chain of execve() calls inside
   one process can then be triggered by running one of the binaries with
   the other binary/binaries as its command-line argument(s). The first
   binary that is executed installs a seccomp() filter which remains
   installed for the life of the process. This filter causes calls to
   mq_notify(2) to fail, but checks for each of the syscall numbers for
   x86-64, i386, and x32, and fails each different architecture-specific
   system call with a different error. An environment variable is employed
   to ensure that only the first binary installs a seccomp() filter.

   Each binary prints out some status information, calls mq_notify() (and
   prints the resulting error number returned in 'errno'), and execs the
   next binary with the remaining command-line arguments.

   Demonstration steps:

   $ cc      -o seccomp_multiarch      seccomp_multiarch.c -lrt
   $ cc -m32 -o seccomp_multiarch_i386 seccomp_multiarch.c -lrt
   $ ./seccomp_multiarch ./seccomp_multiarch_i386 ./seccomp_multiarch

   Before building 'seccomp_multiarch_i386', you may need to install the
   glibc i386 (32-bit) library (e.g., on Ubuntu, this is libc-dev-i386;
   on Fedora, it is glibc-devel.i686).

   NOTE: This program is designed to be run on an Intel x86-64 system.
   If you run this program on a non-Intel multi-arch platform, the
   definitions of architecture and system call numbers below will
   need to be adjusted.

/* Define names for the various system call numbers for the mq_notify()
   system call on Intel architectures:

   x86-64: [cc ...]
        This is the modern 64-bit Intel architecture with 64-bit
        instruction set and 64-bit pointers.

   i386: [cc -m32 ...]
        This is the historical Intel architecture with 32-bit instructions
        and 32-bit pointers (and thus 32-bit address space). As a backward
        compatibility feature, modern 64-bit Intel CPUs can also execute
        i386 programs.

   x32: [cc -mx32 ...]
        This is an alternate ABI for the Intel 64-bit architecture, available
        via the kernel configuration option CONFIG_X86_X32.  This ABI, which
        was added in Linux 3.4 (2012), allows an application to take advantage
        of the modern x86-64 instruction set and 64-bit registers (which are
        more numerous than the register set on i386) while at the same time
        employing 32-bit pointers (and thus 32-bit address space) and 32-bit
        'long'.  The rationale for adding the ABI was that the smaller types
        can result in significant memory savings in some code, and can also
        provide performance improvements in some cases.

        Because some types (e.g., pointers and 'long') under this ABI have
        sizes that are different from the x86-64 ABI, some system calls
        require signatures that differ from x86-64, and thus have different
        syscall numbers.  These numbers all have values >= 512 (see the
        kernel source file arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl), which
        allows some headroom to add new system call numbers for the base
        x86-64 architecture (for example, as at Linux 4.16, the highest
        x86-64 system call number 332 is for statx()).  In addition, when an
        x32 binary makes makes any system call, bit 30 (0x40000000) is set
        in the system call number, which enables the kernel code to
        implement 32-bit "compatibility mode" in cases where it is needed.

        In order to build programs for the x32 architecture, one must have
        user-space support (i.e., binutils tools built for x32 and libraries
        such as glibc built to this ABI), and in many distributions this
        support is *not* provided. A notable distribution that does support
        x32 is Debian (https://wiki.debian.org/X32Port).

        For further information on the x32 ABI, see
        https://sites.google.com/site/x32abi/ and
        https://lwn.net/Articles/456731/
