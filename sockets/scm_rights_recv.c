/* Supplementary program for Chapter 61 */

/* scm_rights_recv.c

   Used in conjunction with scm_rights_send.c to demonstrate passing of
   file descriptors via a UNIX domain socket.

   This program receives a file descriptor sent to a UNIX domain socket.

   Usage is as shown in the usageErr() call below.

   File descriptors can be exchanged over stream or datagram sockets. This
   program uses stream sockets by default; the "-d" command-line option
   specifies that datagram sockets should be used instead.

   This program is Linux-specific.

   See also scm_multi_recv.c.
