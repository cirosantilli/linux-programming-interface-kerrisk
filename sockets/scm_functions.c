/* scm_functions.c

   Functions to exchange ancillary data over UNIX domain sockets.
   These functions are simplistic, in that they ignore the "real" data
   content on the assumption that the sockets are being used only for
   the purposes of exchanging ancillary data. In many real-world
   applications, the application makes use of both the "real" data
   channel and the ancillary data, with some kind of protocol that
   determines how the "real" and ancillary data are used together.
