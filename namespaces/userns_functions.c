   Requiring the user to supply a string that contains newlines is

/* Linux 3.19 made a change in the handling of setgroups(2) and the
   'gid_map' file to address a security issue. The issue allowed
   *unprivileged* users to employ user namespaces in order to drop groups
   from their supplementary group list using setgroups(2).  (Formerly, this
   possibility was available only to privileged processes.) The effect was to
   create possibilities for unprivileged process to access files for which
   they would not otherwise have had permission. (For further details, see
   the user_namespaces(7) man page.)

   The upshot of the 3.19 changes is that in order for a process lacking
   suitable privileges (i.e., one that lacks the CAP_SETGID capability in
   the parent user namespace) to update the 'gid_maps' file, use of the
   setgroups() system call in this user namespace must first be disabled
   by writing "deny" to one of the /proc/PID/setgroups files for this
   namespace.  That is the purpose of the following function.

   Returns: 0 on success; -1 on error. */

           In that case, the file won't exist, and the system won't impose
           the restrictions that Linux 3.19 added. That's fine: we don't
           need to do anything in order to permit 'gid_map' to be updated.

           However, if the error from open() was something other than the
           ENOENT error that is expected for that case, let the user know. */
