/* Supplementary program for Chapter Z */

/* fork_bomb.c

   A fork-bomb program that can be useful when experimenting with
   the cgroups 'pids' controller.

   Usage: fork_bomb num-children [parent-sleep-secs [child-sleep-secs]]

   This program uses fork(2) to create 'num-children' child processes that
   each sleep (i.e., stay in existence) for 'child-sleep-secs' (default:
   1000) seconds.

   The 'parent-sleep-secs' argument specifies an a number of seconds
   (default: 0) that the program should sleep before creating any children.
   The intention of this sleep is to allow the user some time to manipulate
   the cgroup membership of the parent process before any child processes
   are created.
