/* multithread_epoll_wait.c

   If multiple threads are waiting in epoll_wait() on the same FD, then,
   with EPOLLET (edge-triggered notification), only one of the threads
   is woken up when I/O activity occurs. By contrast, with level-triggered
   notification, all threads are woken up.

   To test this:

        $ ./multithread_epoll_wait x            # With EPOLLET
        Thread 0 about to epoll_wait()
        Thread 1 about to epoll_wait()
        Thread 2 about to epoll_wait()
        Thread 3 about to epoll_wait()
        Thread 4 about to epoll_wait()

        main() about to write a byte to pipe

        Thread 4 completed epoll_wait(); ready = 1
        main() about to terminate

        $ ./multithread_epoll_wait              # Without EPOLLET
        Thread 1 about to epoll_wait()
        Thread 4 about to epoll_wait()
        Thread 0 about to epoll_wait()
        Thread 3 about to epoll_wait()
        Thread 2 about to epoll_wait()

        main() about to write a byte to pipe

        Thread 2 completed epoll_wait(); ready = 1
        Thread 3 completed epoll_wait(); ready = 1
        Thread 0 completed epoll_wait(); ready = 1
        Thread 4 completed epoll_wait(); ready = 1
        Thread 1 completed epoll_wait(); ready = 1
        main() about to terminate
